# Bayonet_Ticket_Manager
Management Application for Bayonet-Tickets

The Bayonet Ticket Manager (BT-M), is a sister management application for [Bayonet Tickets](https://github.com/starhound/BayonetTickets).

This application lets IT staff view and track tickets submitted by users of the Bayonet Tickets client and integrates 
similairly to [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat) as the client does.

Currently there are only two states which tickets can be marked as: "In Progress" and "Completed" but there are plans to enable a higher tier of 
workflow management with a "Backlog" or "Pending" option. 

Currently the Ticket Manager does not integrate with tickets generated from [Bayonet Tickets - Android](https://github.com/starhound/BayonetTickets_Android).
